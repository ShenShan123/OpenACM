# **OpenACMv2: Accuracy-Constrained Co-Optimization for Approximate DCiM**

![logo.png](./docs/logo.png)

This repository contains the implementation of:

**OpenACMv2: An Accuracy-Constrained Co-Optimization Framework for Approximate DCiM**

OpenACMv2 extends the original OpenACM compiler and integrates ideas from OpenYield to support

accuracy-constrained two-level optimization for approximate Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM):

1. **Level-I (Architecture-Level Optimization)**
    
    Accuracy-constrained exploration of compressor assignments, approximate PP-column patterns,
    
    and SRAM macro configurations, supported by the PEA-GNN surrogate predictor.
    
2. **Level-II (Transistor-Level Optimization)**
    
    PVT/variation-aware transistor sizing for approximate compressors and SRAM bit-cells
    
    using SPICE Monte Carlo simulation.
    

At this stage, the repository mainly contains the circuit-generation front-end

(multiplier/SRAM/PE generators, RTL templates, and OpenROAD flow scripts).

Two-level ACCO modules will be released incrementally under `examples/` and documented in `docs/`.

## 🔍 Overview

Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) improves efficiency by performing arithmetic close to SRAM arrays.

Approximate DCiM leverages neural networks’ error tolerance to further optimize power, area, and energy.

However, approximate DCiM requires navigating a coupled design space involving:

- Approximate 4–2 compressor choices
- Column-wise approximation patterns
- SRAM macro and bank configuration
- Transistor sizing under PVT conditions
- System-level accuracy constraints (MRED, NMED)

OpenACMv2 introduces **Accuracy-Constrained Co-Optimization (ACCO)** to jointly address these challenges.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Basic DCiM Flow)

### 1. Generate Flow Scripts

`flow_script_generator.py` configures the **SRAM macro placement** and produces the backend scripts used by OpenROAD.

```
python openacm/flow_script_generator/flow_script_generator.py \
    --design_name dcim_pe \
    --top_model top_pe \
    --location_x 30 \
    --location_y 15 
```

The generated multiplier files are stored in `DCIM/tcl/`

### 2. Generate SRAM Macro

`SRAM.py` creates a **behavioral 6T SRAM model** with user-specified bit-width and depth.

```
python openacm/pe_compiler/SRAM.py \
    --data_width 8 \
    --addr_count 16 \
    --rtl_dir ./rtl 
```

The generated multiplier files are stored in `DCIM/rtl/`

### 3. Generate Multiplier and PE

Multiplier:

This step produces an exact or approximate multiplier depending on the configuration.

```
python openacm/multiplier_compiler/multiplier_compiler.py --bit_width 8
```

The generated multiplier files are stored in `DCIM/multiplier/`

PE:

`pe_compiler.py` configures the **PE architecture**, including SRAM interface logic, dataflow control, and multiplier integration.

```
python openacm/pe_compiler/pe_compiler.py \
    --data_width 8 \
    --addr_count 16 \
    --multiplier_module Exact 
```

The generated multiplier files are stored in `DCIM/rtl/`

### 4. Run Backend Flow

Once RTL and script generation is complete, run the physical design flow:

```
./DCIM/tcl/eda.sh
```

This invokes synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, timing, and power analysis to produce a **physically implemented DCiM macro**.

## 📐 OpenACM Circuit Generation Flow

![intro.png](./docs/intro.png)

OpenACM provides a fully automated pipeline that transforms **architecture-level specifications** into a **physically implemented DCiM macro**, enabling end-to-end generation without relying on proprietary SRAM or macro compilers. Starting from the user-defined PE architecture and multiplier configuration, OpenACM progressively constructs the PE logic, approximate/exact multipliers, scalable SRAM arrays, and finally completes a full OpenROAD backend flow.

The compilation flow includes four major components:

- **PE Compiler** – Generates the control logic for SRAM and multipliers, along with input/output buffering. The PE autonomously initializes the SRAM, performs data–SRAM multiplication, and outputs the final results.
- **Multiplier Compiler** – Supports exact multipliers of arbitrary bit widths, precision-configurable approximate multipliers based on customizable 4–2 compressor trees, and logarithmic multipliers for ultra-efficient large-bit-width designs.
- **SRAM Macro Compiler** – Constructs 6T SRAM arrays of any size and produces the associated read/write and peripheral circuitry.
- **Flow-Script Generator** – Produces backend scripts for OpenROAD, performing synthesis, place-and-route, and sign-off analysis to deliver a tape-out–ready DCiM macro.

Through this unified automation flow, OpenACM enables fast design exploration under different accuracy, power, and area constraints, providing a practical open-source solution for accuracy-aware DCiM co-optimization.

## 🧩 ACCO Framework Diagram

![flow.png](./docs/flow.png)

After the two-level ACCO optimization completes, the selected multiplier and SRAM designs
together with their generated RTL and Liberty (.lib) files are automatically exported to the
corresponding directories under `DCIM/`. These optimized components are then used as inputs to
the OpenROAD-based backend flow for final ASIC implementation.
